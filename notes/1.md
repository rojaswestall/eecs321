**EECS 321**

**Lecture 1**



**Look at Topic Outline for Review for Test!!!**

## Programs are Data

- â€¦ which other programs can operate on
  - they can be manipulated by other programs!
  - to run them/Programs can take programs as input (interpreters)
  - a program takes a program as input and gives another one as output, but transformed in some way. Could have same structure and just things renamed (refactoring tools)
  - takes program as input and checks properties. Using `int` where you should be using `string`? (type checker)
- â€¦ which other programs can generate
  - Program that takes a program in a certain language as input and produces another input most likely in another langauge (compiler)
  - program to automate soem aspects of programming (code generators)
  - programs that generate infinite numbers of programs, which would be awesome for test cases! (generative testing)



## Meta-Language vs Object-Language

- Meta-language are programs that do manipulations on object languages

  - Meta-programs are programs in mate-language
  - Programs that are manipulating vs being manipulated need to be distinct

- Meta-langauge will be variant of racket while object-langauges will change!

  

## Different Languages Share Common Aspects

- Found in most languages
  - Operations on basic data (arithmetic)
  - variables and scope =
  - functions
  - state
  - etc.
- Learning languages is easy if you learn above quickly
  - languages come and go but $\lambda$ abides



#### Interpreters

- (Meta-language) program that executes (object-language) programs



## Topic OutLine

- Variables and binding (substition and deferred substitution)
- (Higher-order) functions
- parsing (a little)
- random
- random testing
- recursion
- state
- control
- garbage collection
- type checking and type inference



## Program Manipulators

An **interpreter** takes a program and produces a result

- `bash` - the command line language
- python
- Racket
- X86 processor - takes programs as input and produces results. The result is whatever action the processor executes
- Desktop calculator - 2 + 2 and when you push = it will execute the program
- Algebra student
- **good for understanding program behavior, easy to implement (focus of this course)**

A **compiler** takes a program and produces a program

- `gcc` - takes a program as input and produces a program that can be executed
- `javac` - java compiler. Takes programs written in java and compiles it into a program that can be run by the java virtual machine
- Racket - given a program, will give you an output, but it won't just run the program, it will compile it first
- Python
- X86 processor
- The compilers exist in hardware
- **good for speed, more complex**

Web Broswers have one interpreter and likely mulitple compilers cuz Javascript!

Not a property of a language, property of a system!

Any modern system will have a combination of both **interpreters** and **compilers**



## Grammar for Algebra Programs

![image-20190402114243884](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190402114243884.png){width=2in}

Grammar is sequence of definitions followed by 

Each **meta-variable**, such as <prog>, defines a set

The set <id> is the set of all variable names

The set <num> is the set of all numbers

Example of member of <num>:    2 $\in$ <num>    or    298 $\inâ€‹$ <num> 

Example <expr>:

- choose oen case in the grammar
- pick example for each meta-variable
  - 7 $\in$ <num> 
  - **f** $\in$ <id> 
  - 7 $\in$ <expr> 
- Combine example with literal text
  - 7 $\inâ€‹$ <expr> 
  - **f(7)** $\in$ <expr> 



**program** is sequence of definitions followed by expression

To make a <prog> pick some numbers of <defn>s

**(x + y)** $\inâ€‹$ <prog>

**f(x) = (x + 1)**

**g(y) = f((y - 2))** $\in$ <prog>

**g(7)**



## What is a Language?

A **programming language** is defined by

- grammar that describes what a programs are possible
- rules for evaluatinf any such program to produce a result



Algebra evaluation is defined in terms of evaluation steps:

**f(x) = (x + 1)**

**f(10)** $\rightarrow$ **(10 + 1)** $\rightarrow$ **11**

OR

**(2 + (7 - 4))** $\rightarrow$  **(2 + 3)** $\rightarrow$ **5**



$\rightarrow$ pretty much means evaluate and is defined by a set of pattern-matching rules

##### Rule 1 - One Pattern

â€¦ <id>1(<id>2) = <expr>1 ...

â€¦ <id>1(<expr>2) â€¦ $\rightarrow$  â€¦ <expr>3 ...

where <expr>3 is <expr>1 with <id>2 replaced by <expr>2

##### Rule 2 - $\infinity$: special cases



Rules look different when the interpreter is a program instead of an Algebra student



# Action Items

#### Homework 1

- Due Friday 6pm ðŸ˜’
- Tree traversals and manipulation

#### Brush up on Racket and Read PLAI language documentation

- [Documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/plai/plai-scheme.html)





# ||| in a Nutshell

How to represent data (in Racket / PLAI):

- represent data
  - variants
  - trees and lists
- write functions that process data 
- Resource:
  - [Documentation](https://htdp.org/)



### For a GUI

![image-20190402121015466](/Users/gabrielrojas-westall/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190402121015466.png){width=50%}

- Labels
  - a label string
- buttons
  - a label string
  - enabled state
- lists
  - a list of choice strings
  - selected item

```scheme
#lang plai

; This is defining the struct so we can make many GUIs! Just like this

(define-type GUI
		[label (text string?)]
    [button (text string?)
            (enabled? boolean?)]
    [choice (items (listof string?))
            (selected integer?)])
```



For Read Screen Function:

```scheme
; read-screen : GUI -> list-of-string
(define (read-screen g)
  (type-case GUI g
    [label (t) (list t)]
  	[button (t e?) (list t)]
		[choice (i s) i]))

;; t, e?, i, s, are all just names we are giving as the field we defined in the structs

(test (read-screen (label "Hi"))
	'("Hi"))
(test (read-screen (button "Ok" true))
	'("Ok"))
(test (read-screen (choice '("Apple" "Banana") 0))
	'("Apple" "Banana"))
```
